a (python) project from scratch to train new skills like tdd ci/cd microservices uml cloud &amp; so on

### just a beginning 
This project is aim to work with differents new skills that I'm learning with old ones.
It's like more a 'carnet de notes' where i'll lay down experiences and feedback.

### So let's go !!!
