a (python) project from scratch to train new skills like tdd ci/cd microservices uml cloud &amp; so on

### just a beginning 
This project is aim to work with differents new skills that I'm learning with old ones.
It's like more a 'carnet de notes' where i'll lay down experiences and feedback.

First of all It's my first Python project, so it could be sometimes use bad solutions ... but it's rather than create a simple project from scratch including devops-driven development.

### So let's go !!!
